# Music Releases

This is our first React project. We practiced to use components and props. We used data based om spotifys API to make an app that shows the upcoming album and singel releases.

## The problem

It took some time for us to understand how to connect the different parts of the script. We also had some problems with the external links.

Whit some stack overflow magic - we finally made it work. We also found the hover effect challenging, and found out that we could lay an hover on top of another. We made the team work work even though we had very different schedules
